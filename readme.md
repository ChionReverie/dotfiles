# Chion's Dotfiles

## Getting Started
Start with the documentation [index](docs/00-index.md) for more details.

## Project Structure
* `docs` - Further documentation and instructions on how I set things up. 
* `home` - Settings and assets placed relative to the user's `$HOME` directory (Example: `/home/chion`)
* `root` - Settings and assets which should be placed relative to the user's root directory (IE `/`)
* `script` - Shell scripts which may be used in automating installation.
