* [ ] Link `.profile.d` and `.bashrc`

* [ ] Prepare `.gitconfig` with...
    * `user.name`
    * `user.email`
    * `core.editor`

* [ ] Basic install of Desktop Environment 
    * [ ] What steps do I need for that?

File/Directory Links:
* [ ] Record of links which are managed by the dotfiles tool
    * This lets us safely unlink old/unneeded configs if they change
    * This also lets us check if a link is not managed by the tool, for safety reasons
