## OS Installation

I have prepared a list of steps to take in installing Arch Linux
with my preferred app choices. The steps are presented in the order
I recommend taking them, but depending on the use case of the system,
some phases may be omitted. (For example, a desktop environment is
unnecessary on a headless server system.)

- [1.0 - Install Arch Linux](os/10-install-arch.md)
- [1.1 - System Setup](os/11-setup-system.md)
- [2.0 - Desktop Environment](os/20-desktop-environment.md)
- [5.0 - User Setup](os/50-users.md)
- [6.0 - App Selection](os/60-apps.md)

There is also a TODO list with a list of tasks which I still need to 
complete.
